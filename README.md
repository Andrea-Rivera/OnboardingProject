l# OnboardingProject

This project is separated into two folders:
- MVP-Back End created in Visual Studio .NET framework 
- React-Front End created in Visual Code

To run the project first I have executed the FinalOnboardingTask inside the MVP-Back End Folder
Then, I executed the React Front end folder in visual Code.


In azure I have deployed the back end:
https://finalonboarding.azurewebsites.net/api/customers
https://finalonboarding.azurewebsites.net/api/products
https://finalonboarding.azurewebsites.net/api/stores
https://finalonboarding.azurewebsites.net/api/sales

And the Front-End:
https://finalonboardingreact.azurewebsites.net
